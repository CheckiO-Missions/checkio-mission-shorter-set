        I have no idea how to start solving this mission

    <div class="answer">
        The idea I offer you is to correctly slice sorted list.

    <div class="question">
        What instrument of Python should I start from to implement this idea into code?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Since set is an unordered collection, you need to create new ordered collection,
        which can be sorted. The list object is fine.
        So, first you need <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted'>
        sorted()</a> function to create sorted list from your input set.
        <pre class="brush: python">
data = {1, 5, 2, 4}
order = sorted(data)
print(order) # [1, 2, 4, 5] you got list and it is sorted ascending.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        And how to remove amount of minimum and maximum values from the list?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Your list is sorted ascending, so it starts from smallest
        values and ends with biggest. Now you may use <a target='_blank'
        href='https://www.pythontutorial.net/advanced-python/python-slicing/'>slicing</a>
        with positive and negative indexes to get partial list.
        <pre class="brush: python">
order_sl = order[1:-1] # you get new list from previous with
                    # sliced off first and -first(last) values
print(order_sl) # [2, 4]
        </pre>

        Ok. I still don't understand, what indexes to use
        in my solution for slicing.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You have input value 'total'. It shows how many smallest and biggest
        numbers should be deleted from set. Use it as positive and negative index
        to slice them off your sorted list.
        <pre class="brush: python">
order = sorted(data)
order_sl = order[total:-total]
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class='question-answer'>
    <div class='question'>
        After previous step I have a list, but the solution must return set.
        What should I do?
    </div>
    <div class='answer'>
        Yes. You just need to create set from your list with
        set(order_sl) and return it.
        <pre class="brush: python">
order = sorted(data)
order_sl = order[total:-total]

return set(order_sl)     
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class='question-answer'>
    <div class='question'>
        And the final question. My slicing doesn't work if total == 0.
        How to include this case in solution?
    </div>
    <div class='answer'>
        You have to check 'total' value before other commands to avoid
        doing unnecessary calculations.
        You may do this with 'if total == 0:', but the pythonic way
        to do this is just 'if not total:'. Since there is no amount
        to remove, you return the initial set in this case.
        And don't forget to declare function itself. 
        <pre class="brush: python">
def remove_min_max(data: set[int], total:int) -> set[int]:
    
    if not total:
        return data

    order = sorted(data)
    order_sl = order[total:-total]

    return set(order_sl)
        </pre>
