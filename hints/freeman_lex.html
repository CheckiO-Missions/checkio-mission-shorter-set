            I have no idea how to start solving this mission
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            The idea I offer you is the following.
            If the set is not empty, to create additional sorted list.
            Then, taking a certain amount of values from the beginning
            and the end of the list, to delete them from the set.
            Return the updated set.

        <div class="question">
            What instruments of Python should I use to implement this idea into code?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
           You will need if statement, to check emptiness of set, sorted() method to get sorted list from set,
           range() to iterate over the list and discard() set method to remove the value from set without
           raising an error in case of absence. Inside discard put values from beginning and end of list
           using list indexing.

        <div class="question">
            Could you please show me some code blocks?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Let's see:
            <pre class="brush: python">
def remove_min_max(data: set[int], total:int) -> set[int]:
    
    if ...: # check if set is not empty with len() of set not equal 0
        order = ... # creat sorted list from the set with sorted()
        for i in range(...): # use input amount
            # remove (with discard()) from data values from beginning and end of list
            # using normal and negative list indexing
    return data
            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="question-answer">
        <div class="question">
            And the final question. I need to see the final code.
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <pre class="brush: python">
    number = 56
    text = str(number)
    text_length = len(text)
    # the variable text_length now contains length of the string text
            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>

        <div class="question">
            One last question. How my final solution will look like?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <pre class="brush: python">
    def number_length(number: int) -> int:
        text = str(number)
        return len(text)
            </pre>
    
            <p>Or you can do it in one line</p>
    
            <pre class="brush: python">
    def number_length(number: int) -> int:
        return len(str(number))
            </pre>
